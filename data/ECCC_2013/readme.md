The dataset includes ECCC lake-wide observations on (1) Hydrodynamics (e.g., temperature and velocity profiles), (2) Water Quality, (3) Cladophora, (4) ECOPAR; and also includes data from other agencies such as NYSDEC, OMNR and USGS.
 
Below, I listed the shared data in tree form for clarity.
 
Sample depths under NYSDEC_OMNR_USGS structure field, are all 1m below the surface; and depth shows the site depth (as shared with us).
 
In the shared file, “-999” indicates that the data is missing, “999” indicates the data is bottle blank, “998” indicates that the data is field blank.
